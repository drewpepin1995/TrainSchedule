# TrainSchedule

The Train schedule app is a train schedule that is constantly updating by pulling data from firebase, and calculating details about the train like what time the next train is arriving as well as how many minutes until arrival. It also allows you to manually add a new train to the schedule, which also adds the data to the firebase database.
